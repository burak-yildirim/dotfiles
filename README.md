# dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repo.

## prerequisites

python3, git. dotfiles are managed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which doesn't require installation.

## installation

run 'install' on linux and 'install.ps1' on windows. install scripts doesn't delete already existing files on the path.
still, run them at your own risk.
